Here is my vision. A support agent is chatting with a user (on an intercom looking website), the user is having some kind of trouble but it is very verbose. I want the frame to be incapsulated in a browser just as the image you just provided. The support agent is given vauge information about the problem so they dont know what to do. The agent opens up a panel with user information copys the user email. The camera zooms in on the tabs in the browser and the agent clicks the "new tab" button. A new tab is opened and the agent navigates to app.glimt.support. Once they are in glimt they look up the user through the dashboard looks at the session. The support agent identifies the problem and leaves a comment, the camera should zoom in on the comment input. The agent marks the session as public and copeis the link. The agent goes back to the support tab in their browser and tells the user they have identified the problem and have sent it to the software development team to be fixed. We zoom in on the browser tabs again and the agent opens a new tab and navigates to slack. Slack should be a mockup of what slack looks like and the user navigates to the "bugs" channel in our mockup slack app and the agent sends the information to the development team to be fixed
