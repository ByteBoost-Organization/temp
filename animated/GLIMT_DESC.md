Project Description for Cursor
Product: Glimt

Overview:
Glimt is a privacy-first session replay tool purpose-built for customer support teams. It captures high-fidelity replays of users’ web sessions, allowing support agents to instantly see what a user experienced — without needing to ask for steps to reproduce. Glimt is optimized for empathy, speed, and collaboration, not analytics or dev debugging.

Target Audience:
Support agents, support team leads, and heads of customer experience at SaaS companies. The tool is especially valuable for teams aiming to reduce resolution time, improve customer satisfaction, and avoid unnecessary escalations to developers.

Purpose of the Video:
This 60-second animated video is a marketing explainer designed to:

Introduce Glimt to potential users and buyers

Highlight the pain points of traditional support workflows (guesswork, dev pinging, slow resolutions)

Showcase how Glimt works visually through UI animations

Demonstrate key features (replays, timestamped comments, shareable links, privacy masking)

Reinforce value propositions (speed, clarity, collaboration, compliance)

End with a strong CTA to join the waitlist

Tone and Style:
Modern, clean, professional. Inspired by videos like Artisan's launch, the animation should be fast-paced, visually engaging, and UI-driven — focusing on the product experience rather than abstract metaphors.
